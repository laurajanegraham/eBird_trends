# Data preparation
Currently working with the data for hummingbirds from Colorado. The dataset has been generated in Python and I have filtered it such that only locations which have greater than 3 observations in at least one month are included. This reduces the number of locations from `r nrow(locations_full)` to `r nrow(locations_sml)`. 

The final data output from Python is a 4-dimensional array where the dimensions are: Year, Location, Species and Replicate. 

```{r load_data}
load("data/hummingbirds_colorado.rda")

# size of array
dim(wide_dat)
```

# Initial models
## Basic dynamic occupancy model (no covariates)
